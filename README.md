This is a document about managing complexity. I had to work through both pre-recorded lessons that were provided(and did my own research) and answer the following questions.

1. Why is it important to manage complexity in Software?
2. What are the factors that create complexity in Software?
3. What are ways in which complexity can be managed in JavaScript?
4. Are there implications of not managing complexity on a small scale?
5. List a couple of codified style guide rules, and explain them in detail.
6. To date, what bug has taken you the longest to fix - why did it take so long?
